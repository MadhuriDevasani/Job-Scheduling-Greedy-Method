Job scheduling using the greedy method is an algorithmic approach to solve the problem of selecting a set of jobs with given deadlines and profits, such that the profit earned is maximum. The problem assumes that each job can be completed in one unit of time and that a job can only be scheduled before its deadline.
The greedy approach chooses the job with the maximum profit and schedules it before its deadline. The algorithm sorts the jobs based on their profit in decreasing order and assigns them a time slot before the deadline, starting with the highest profit job. If there are multiple jobs with the same profit, the algorithm can sort them based on their deadline to break the tie.
The algorithm maintains a schedule of jobs to be executed in the form of an array or a list. It starts with an empty schedule and iteratively adds the highest profit job that can be scheduled before its deadline. Once a job is scheduled, it is removed from the list of available jobs.
At the end of the process, the algorithm returns the schedule of jobs in the order they have been scheduled and the total profit earned.
Overall, job scheduling using the greedy algorithm is a simple and efficient approach to solving the problem. However, it is not always guaranteed to provide an optimal solution, and there may be scenarios where the greedy approach may fail to provide the best solution. In such scenarios, dynamic programming approaches can be used to provide optimal solutions.
